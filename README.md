Nayak S, Lee D, Patel-Hett S, Pittman DD, Martin SW, Heatherington AC, Vicini P, Hua F. Using a Systems Pharmacology Model of the Blood Coagulation Network to Predict the Effects of Various Therapies on Biomarkers. CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol. 2015 Jul;4(7):396-405. doi: 10.1002/psp4.50. Epub 2015 Jun 19. PMID: 26312163; PMCID: PMC4544053.

This project was completed for 2019 Bioinformatics Class in Handong Global University.
We modified a vesion from MatLab to R to achieve more readability and writability.
Unfortunately, compared to MatLab, R internals are single-threaded, making its performance much slower.
We did not include the simulated annealing code block, as it was home-made and not optimal.
